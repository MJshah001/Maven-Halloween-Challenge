# Maven Halloween Challenge 🎃

This repository contains my submission for the **Maven Halloween Challenge**, a data-driven project to identify the top 3 Halloween candies that would make any house a favorite for trick-or-treaters. Using a dataset of 85 popular candies ranked by votes, I analyzed and visualized the data to determine the most crowd-pleasing treats. 

## Project Goal 🥅

**Objective**: Use data analysis to find the three types of Halloween candy that appeal to the broadest audience. 

Based on online votes and candy rankings, the challenge was to select treats that guarantee satisfaction across different candy preferences.

## Approach 🚀

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**: 
   - Utilized **Python & Pandas** to load and explore the dataset. Examined relevant features that might influence popularity, such as chocolate, fruitiness, and candy type.
  
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce data complexity while retaining key insights. This simplified data visualization and allowed for more focused clustering.
  
3. **Clustering Analysis**:
   - Performed clustering to group similar types of candies. This identified distinct candy categories, including:
     - Fruity candies
     - Chocolatey treats
     - High piece count candies (like M&Ms)
     - Reese’s-based favorites

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created an **interactive scatter plot in Tableau** to visualize clusters and analyze the top choices for candies. This visualization helped in selecting the final 3 candies based on popularity within clusters.

## Results 🏆

After a detailed analysis, the top 3 recommended candies were:
1. **Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup**
2. **Twix**
3. **Starburst**

These selections maximize appeal by covering a variety of candy preferences, from chocolate lovers to fruity candy fans.

## Tools & Technologies 🛠

- **Python**: For data loading, manipulation, and PCA analysis
- **Pandas**: To organize and analyze data
- **Machine Learning (PCA)**: For dimensionality reduction
- **Tableau**: For interactive data visualization and clustering

## Lessons Learned 📘

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
- Applying **PCA** for feature reduction in data visualization
- Using clustering to identify natural groupings within data
- Leveraging **Tableau** to create interactive, insightful plots
- Making data-driven decisions to extract meaningful insights
